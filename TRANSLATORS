Hi, kindly people who wish to translate our miserable application.

All you have to do is to make a new directory for your language you wish to translate, in po/, then copy po/shredder.pot into your new folder. Then translate, and use msgfmt in the usual way to produce a .mo file to be copied into the locale/ folder.

Thanks for your work. :D
