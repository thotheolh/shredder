Building from source:

1. Dependencies. You'll need the libgtk-3-dev package, gcc, and the libglib2.0-dev package. On Debian-based systems, the command:

	sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev gcc build-essential

should install all of these for you.

2. Simply run:

	make

in this directory to automatically build the project. 

Running from source:

Shredder requires the path to its UI file as a first argument. We're working on this, as it's clunky and unnecessary, but that's the way it is for now. Here's an example execution from the source tree directory:

	./shredder shredder.ui
