Shredder is an application for securely deleting files.

We need:

-Data expert. Is our data *actually* deleted? How can our algorithm be better? Recommended number of iterations?

-Translations support. Gettext is preferable.

-Code optimisers. Code is a bit messy at present and could be faster.

-Testing. Only two people on a project, doesn't get tested very much.

You can contact the main two developers at:

We don't bite, really! And any level of work will be rewarded in an entry in the about dialog. :)
