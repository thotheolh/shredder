Hi developers!

If you're interested in our application, and know python and preferably pygtk or pygobject, we'd like to have you contribute.

Have a look over our code, see what you think of it, and how it slots together.

Then, if you think you'd like to add some features, or fix some bugs, ask to be added to the git committers by emailing either:

Tay Thotheolh: <twzgerald@gmail.com>
Michael Rawson: <michaelrawson76gmail.com>

Also, have a look in the TODO folder to see some things that need fixing.
